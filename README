An implementation of the Gale & Church parallel text alignment algorithm


This repository contains the implementation of the alignment algorithm used for
the Coral project.

Coral is a parallel text alignment tool developed for a university project at
the TakeLab (Text Analysis and Knowledge Engineering Laboratory), an NLP
research group run by prof. Bojana Dalbelo-Bašić at the Faculty of Electrical
Engineering and Computing at the University of Zagreb, Croatia.
For more information about TakeLab, please see http://takelab.fer.hr/.

Coral is a powerful application with a an easy-to-use graphical user interface.
It can be used for both manual parallel text alignment and for automated
alignment with the help of this implementation Gale and Church's algorithm.
It's available for download at http://takelab.fer.hr/coral/ along with more
information about its development and the student team that worked on it.

This Github repository, however, contains only the Gale and Church alignment
algorithm I implemented, without a GUI and additional sentence segmentation
code.
It also contains a DataModel class implemented by Željko Rumenjak, as this
class was used as a data holder for the parallel texts.

The code here can simply cloned from this Git repository and then added to other
existing projects in need of an alignment algorithm.
